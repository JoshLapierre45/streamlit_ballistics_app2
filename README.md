# Ballistics Explorer – Machine Learning Web App

## Overview

This project is an interactive Streamlit web application that combines classical ballistics calculations with a machine learning model to estimate **hit probability** for a rifle shot.

A user can:
- Adjust inputs such as target distance, muzzle velocity, ballistic coefficient, wind speed, and shooter skill level.
- Visualize bullet trajectory and related ballistics metrics.
- Use a trained logistic regression model to estimate the probability of hitting the target.

This project is submitted as **Option C: Build a Web-App for a Machine Learning Model**.
