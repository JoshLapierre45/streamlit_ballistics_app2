## Ballistics Toolkit

A multi-page Streamlit application for exploring external ballistics, visualizing cartridge performance, and estimating hit probability using a calibrated logistic model (with optional SHAP explainability).

This project was developed for the MSU Denver CS39AE course.

## App Pages
## Home

Overview of the dataset

Auto-loads built-in ballistics data

Links to other modules

## Hit Probability

Upload shooter history (CSV) or use the built-in dataset automatically

Supports per-shot or aggregate (hits/shots) formats

Feature engineering (wind components, target size, MV SD, group size, DA, etc.)

Trains a calibrated logistic regression model

Predicts p(hit) vs range

Includes SHAP feature importance plot for model explainability

## EDA Gallery

Four visualization types

“How to read this chart” explanations

Insights for velocity, energy, drop, wind drift

## Dashboard

KPIs + filters + linked visuals

Compare cartridges interactively

Download filtered CSVs

## Future Work

Model comparisons (HGBT / XGBoost)

Better shooter-history templates

Ballistics + hit-probability integration

Ethics and safety considerations

## Dataset Structure

outcome per shot OR (hits, shots)

## Tech Stack

Streamlit multipage app

Pandas / NumPy for wrangling

scikit-learn for modeling

SHAP for feature interpretability

Altair for visualization

## Run Locally
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<JoshLapierre45>/streamlit_ballistics_app.git
cd streamlit_ballistics_app

2. Create & activate a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch the app
streamlit run app.py

## Notes

This tool is for educational and advisory purposes only.

Actual ballistics results may differ due to barrel, weather, lot variation, and environmental effects.

Always follow safe shooting practices and pressure-tested load data.
